Do THIS and move on
1. Lock the Hero (copy you can paste)

What We’ve Shipped
Software products and platforms we’ve designed, built, and delivered for companies operating in production.

That’s it. No second paragraph. Clean. Product-first. Done.

2. Rename the Section (important for SEO)

Change any “Selected Work” / “Projects” label to:

Shipped Products & Systems

Google likes “products” + “systems”. Humans get it instantly.

3. Card Formula (don’t overthink)

Every card should follow this exact pattern:

Title
(Product / System name)

One-liner
What it is + who it’s for (plain English)

Tags
Web App · Platform · Internal Tool · Client-Facing · Infrastructure

Status
● Shipped
● In Production
● Actively Maintained

CTA
View Details →

If a card doesn’t fit this, cut it.

4. Bottom Trust Line (copy/paste)

Additional products and systems are private or client-restricted.

This line alone upgrades the page 20%.

5. STOP here

Do not:

Add more sections

Rewrite philosophy

Add animations

Chase perfection

You already did the hard part. This page is now:

Product-focused

SEO-safe

Credible

Not agency-coded
